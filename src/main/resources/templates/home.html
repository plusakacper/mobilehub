                <li><h5>WHY DO CUSTOMERS LOVE US?</h5>We have been in the business for quite a while now, and in that time we have not only managed to make close relationships with numerous partners, but also to recognize what people need. At MobileHub you will find quality products from top brands at consistently low prices. We are offering a wide range of smartphones and tablets, notebooks and computer equipment, headsets and smartwatches, small household appliances and other electronics. Intelligent filter options and complete product information help customers to find exactly the products that suit them.</li>
                <br/>
                <li><h5>BEGINNING</h5>MobileHub website was launched in 2011, but its story actually began some 8 years before that when a group of college friends decided to go into business together. We started selling phones in shops, but our combined ambition, drive and abilities soon made us look for new challenges and new markets. Starting an online shop provided for both and allowed us to develop a strong international presence in a number of EU countries.</li>
                <br/>
                <li><h5>TODAY</h5>MobileHub is today an e-commerce platform which enables third party sellers to sell their products to customers using the platform. Collective experience of our team members and the years we have spent in the business allowed us to develop a vast network of partners, ensuring that our customers will always find what they are looking for. This also means that we are able to offer great prices, which are constantly being updated and follow the shifts in the market.</li>
